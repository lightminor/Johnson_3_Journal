    Create a class for 'hero'
	Player Alex = new Player();
public class Player{
        int health = 100;
        int weapon = 0;
        int level = 0;
        int dex = 3;

        public int getHealth() {
            return health;
        }

        public void setHealth(int health) {
            this.health = health;
        }

        public int getWeapon() {
            return weapon;
        }

        public void setWeapon(int weapon) {
            this.weapon = weapon;
        }

        public int getLevel() {
            return level;
        }

        public void setLevel(int level) {
            this.level = level;
        }

        public int getDex() {
            return dex;
        }

        public void setDex(int dex) {
            this.dex = dex;
        }

        public int getPerception() {
            return perception;
        }

        public void setPerception(int perception) {
            this.perception = perception;
        }

        public int getScore() {
            return score;
        }

        public void setScore(int score) {
            this.score = score;
        }
        int perception = 3;
        int score = 0;
    }
}
    The class should contain:
    variables for health, score, power/weapon, dexterity, perception, level, x, y, z, and a symbol
    There should also be a class constructor accepting inputs for name, x, y, and symbol
    Provide an example of initializing a hero object with your name

Player Alex = new Player();

    Explain why you would not initialize the hero in class hero.

you would not intialize the hero in the hero class because it would 
be counter-productive it would not be able to set values for that class 
because it the object itself is set in the class
