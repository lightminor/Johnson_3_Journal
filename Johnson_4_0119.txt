What slick game did you create?
I Have not finished my game

What challenges did you solve
I figured out how make animations work and how to check if a button is pressed

Before the Winter break, you were admonished to finish your maps and spritesheets - so that you would be ready to go with the game when we got back. Did you? Why or why not?
yes i did , because it gave me time to work on my code
Were you able to meet the timeline? Why or why not? [Focus on what you did or did not do. Journals ascribing blame to others will not be considered.
no i was not , because I had much code i needed to do ,and not enough time
