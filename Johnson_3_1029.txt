	my game is not really a game ,well only by the strictest
definitons is it a "game".  it's just pick a number 
from 1-100 and see if your right. A game is a way to compete ,
cooperate , or just be silly with your friends , its a way to 
express yourself and pass time and have fun. this is not following
the spirit of gaming and having fun.
