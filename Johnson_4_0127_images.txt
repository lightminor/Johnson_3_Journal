How do you add an image to a slick game?
	first find an image you want to use, and putting in the res folder, then call said image
	and .draw it which brings it into the game

Where is the image drawn? [What code? Be specific.]
	The image is drawn in a method usasally in the main body of the code, an example would be:
	B.currentImage.draw(B.x , B.y);
