	more specifically , why will we use it?


A pseudocode is an description of an operating principle of a computer program algorithm
, a pseudocode is used in a description of an algrithm , so all coders can understand it even if its in another coding language
, we will use it because it allows us to translate different coding languages into things we can understand and learn abour
