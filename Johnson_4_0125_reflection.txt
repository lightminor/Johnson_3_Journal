	I could have focused on finsihing other parts of the game, isntead of working on smaller
parts , 

	I start by reviewing my code, and checking for syntax or logic errors, i then check to 
see if fixing said errors fixes the problem , if not then I look closer on more likely areas
and if i still cannot fix the problem i then ask for a second perspective from a teacher or peer
