In the Array Game assignment you have had to review and revisit concepts you may have forgotten 
about. These will all be tested on the final exam!

What is an array?
an array is a container that can carry multiple different values, but only from a 
single data type

How does one make a simple array of Strings?
String[] TheStringArray = new String[]{"x","y","z"};
What is the syntax for a 2-D array?
int[][] 2d = new int [10][10];
What is the syntax for a 3-D array?
int[][][] 3d =  new int [10][10][10]
How does one change the value for the third value in a one dimensional array? [Give specific code]
int[3] = 8;
What is the syntax for a while loop?
x = 0;

while (x < 3){
system.out.println("x = " + x);
x++
}

Why use while loops in your game?
while loops allow you to do many more things, faster and  easier than without.
 
Your game should be in a method outside of main --- How will you call your game in main?
by calling the method that my game is in.

Why was it recommended that you use .toLowerCase() with your Scanner input?
it allows the computer to pick up on lowercase input instead of just uppercase

You should use different methods when moving the protagonist and to check for intersections. 
How? Why?
by calling the methods where necassary , you should do this beacuse it allows for cleaner more
organized code.

What values will you pass across methods? how? why
you would pass values like the protaganist coordinates and the coordiantes of the traps
because it would allow you to have the protaginst and traps interact and allow more 
complex gameplay
