How can / will you make the orb move in the direction you are facing?
Explain and provide specific code.

To make my orb move i could make a method that changes its x and y every hundred miliseconds
and run that method for every tile that passes through


private int timerun;

if(Player.direction == up){
	Orb.x = Orb.x + 5;
	timerun++;
     if(timerun >= 10){
	Orb.x = 20000;
	Orb.y = 20000;
}
