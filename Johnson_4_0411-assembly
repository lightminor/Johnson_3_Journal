    What is assembly?
it is an programming language used for converting high-level code to machine code

   What is it good for?
it is used for coverting languages like to C to machine code 

    How is assembly different than Java?
java and assembly are extreme opposites , java is an top-level programming language that is 
easily understandable and very portable while assembly is a ultra-low level
machine code conversion language that is virtually unportable and 
relativly hard to understand though easier than actual machine code

    What are differences between high level and low level languages?
high level languages are easily portable and easier to debug and understand while 
lower level languages are not portable and are harder to debug and is very machine dependent
   
 Which type is Java? How do you know, i.e., what characteristics does it have of
     that language type?
java is an high-level programming language that is easy to understand and debug and is not 
machine dependent meaning it can be moved from one computer to another and still be understood
by the new computer 
    
Which type is Assembly? How do you know, i.e., what characteristics does it have of
     that language type?
assembly is a low-level language that is machine-dependent and harder to understand though 
it is easier to understand than machine code which is notoriously hard to work with, it is 
not portable and debugging is a greuling proccess
