Questions:

What is a method?
Which methods did you use and how did you use them in your guessing game program?
What is a while loop?
How did you use a while loop, boolean, and counter in your guessing game? 

Answers: 

A method is a way to express commands for a computer 

I used While loops , if else statements , scanners and other methods 

a while loop continuesly checks to see if a certain statement is still accurate if it is not
then it stops/starts something else

I used them to create a system of lives where with each wrong guess you lose a life and if
you lose all your lives you lose the game
