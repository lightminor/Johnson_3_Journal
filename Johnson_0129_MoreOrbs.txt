What is a class constructor?
A class constructor is a method that creates classes(objects specificly) to be used
in later methods and where needed.

What should be included in a class constructor for orbs? Why?
At least one ArrayList and variables that help the main game identify and
put the orbs in the game , such as X and Y coordinates and booleans like "isVisible"
this helps the game figure out what to do with the game and how to use it in context with 
the other components of the game

What methods should the orb have? why? 
The orb should have methods declaring important variables, it should also have
methods that choose the image used to represent it in-game. this would be 
benifical because it makes the main code (Unwavering) not as messy and allows for 
seperation of the code which makes it easier to understand and read
