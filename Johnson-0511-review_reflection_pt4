    Explain in your own words -- what happens with nested for loops?
    E.g.,

            for (int i = 0; i <= board[0].length - 1; i++) {
                        for (int j = 0; j <= board[1].length - 1; j++) { ....}
          

a nested for loop is a loop that is inside another loop,it runs after loop containing it runs 
, then again after each consecutive run.
