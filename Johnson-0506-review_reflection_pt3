    Given mymap[67][43] 
	Which is the x coordinate?
	the x coordinate is the second value 

	Which is the y coordinate? Why?
	the y is the first value.
	this is becuase it looks for the lateral value first which is actually the on the y axis	 

     

    Consider:

            for (int i = 0; i <= map[0].length - 1; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j <= map[1].length - 1; j++) {
if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888"); #a
                    if (j < map[1].length - 1) {
                      if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888"); #a
                        } else if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                            System.out.print("."); #e
                        } else {
                            System.out.print(map[i][j]); #b
                        }
                    } else {
                        if (map[i][j] != 'x') {
                            System.out.println("."); #c
                        } else {
                            System.out.println(map[i][j]); #d
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
            
            
          

    Write the code from line #a and explain what it does.
if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888");
this prints "8888" if the coordinate is in the y axis


    Write the code from line #b and explain what it does.
System.out.print(map[i][j]); 
it prints the values of all array points ie if the array point [2][2] = 'a'
then at that point it prints that value 


    Write the code from line #c and explain what it does. Explain how its different than #e
System.out.println("."); 
e prints the words written on the same line and c prints the words written on a new line


    Write the code from line #d and explain what it does.
System.out.println(map[i][j]); 
this prints the values of all array points and puts each one on a new line


    
    Explain how to use a boolean with a while loop. Provide a very specific use case and code example.
    boolean isdead = false;
    while (isdead == false){
    playthegame();
    if(isdead == true){
    deathscreen();
    }
    }
    
    Explain the use of static.
    static means that the variable it is affecting is always the same across all given
    examples of the varible and nomatter where in the code it is
    
    
    Provide an example of how you could use an object with your game. Give a code example.
    public class Player{
    boolean isdead = false;
    int x;
    int y;
    }
    Player player1 = new Player;
    if (player1.x == trap.x && player1.y ==  trap.y){
    deathscreen();
    }
